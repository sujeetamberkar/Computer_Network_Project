The OSI model is like a sandwich of 7 layers.


--- Layer 1 ---

This is like the bread - it's the foundation of the sandwich and supports all the other layers.

--- Layer 2 --- 

The data link layer, is like the peanut butter - it's all about connecting things together. 

--- Layer 3 --- 

The network layer, is like the jelly - it helps to route things around and make sure they get to the right place. 

--- Layer 4 ---- 

The transport layer, is like the mayo - it helps to keep things moving smoothly and without any hiccups.


--- Layer 5 ---

The session layer, is like the cheese - it helps to establish and manage connections between devices.

--- Layer 6 ---

The presentation layer, is like the lettuce - it helps to format and present data in a way that's easy to understand. Finally,


--- Layer 7 ----

The application layer, is like the bacon - it's the delicious finishing touch that makes everything better.

In code, each layer of the OSI model has its own specific function and responsibilities. The lower layers deal with physical and data transmission aspects, while the upper layers deal with more abstract concepts like formatting and data management. By following the OSI model, developers can ensure that their networks and applications are built on a strong foundation and are able to communicate effectively with each other.
